I'm currently doing freelance work full time. If you'd like to discuss a potential project, you can contact me directly by [email](mailto:bethanyhgardner@gmail.com) or through [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01611ffda97429136e).

## Data Visualization

Hit the limits of what Excel can do? A lot of the small contracts I've been doing for academic and academic-adjacent clients have been data visualization, and I recently made a bonus episode and [tutorial code](https://bethanyhgardner.github.io/lingthusiasm-vowel-plots/) with Lingthusiasm about how to make vowel plots. I primarily work in R using ggplot, and my rates for data visualization projects are currently $35-$50/hr.

## Statistical Consulting & Programming

I also do statistical consulting and programming for both academic and industry clients. I can:

*   Advise you on which statistical tests are most appropriate for your research question
*   Write analysis code in R, making it fully reproducible using Quarto/R Markdown
*   Translate code and replicate existing analyses from SAS, STATA, SPSS, or Jamovi

Most of my expertise is in regression modeling, particularly in mixed-effects models for hypothesis testing, but I'm also familiar with Bayesian frameworks, ANOVAs, and SEM.

You can see examples of my reproducible analysis code published alongside my [dissertation](https://github.com/bethanyhgardner/dissertation) and [recent publication](https://github.com/bethanyhgardner/gender-bias-names). I'd love to work more with academics about getting reproducible analysis work flows set up, since open science doesn't work very well if other people (and future you) struggle to understand or reproduce the shared code.

My rates are currently $35-$45/hr for programming jobs (i.e., you know what stats you want to do and just need someone to set it up in R) and $50-$65/hr for consulting + programming jobs (i.e., you also want me to decide what stats to do). 

## Data Wrangling & Experiment Coding

I primarily work in R using the tidyverse, but I'm also comfortable working in Python and Excel. More specific to psychology and linguistics research, I have experience:

*   Coding experiments, primarily in PCIbex and also in MATLAB, Qualtrics, and PsychoPy
*   Setting up online data collection to use AWS storage and time-consuming models to run on AWS servers
*   Translating legacy code that's worked for years but is accumulating dependency and compatability issues, then validating the new code
*   Recording and preprocessing eyetracking, audio, and text data

My rates for data preprocessing and data collection code are currently $35-$45/hr.
