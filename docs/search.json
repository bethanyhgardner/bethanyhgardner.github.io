If you’d like to discuss a potential project, you can contact me directly by email or through Upwork.\n\n\nData VisualizationStatistical Consulting & ProgrammingData Wrangling & Experiment Coding\n\n\nHit the limits of what Excel can do? A lot of the small contracts I’ve been doing for academic and academic-adjacent clients have been data visualization, and I recently made a bonus episode and tutorial code with Lingthusiasm about how to make vowel plots. I primarily work in R using ggplot, and my rates for data visualization projects are currently $35-$50/hr.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\nI also do statistical consulting and programming for both academic and industry clients. I can:\n\nAdvise you on which statistical tests are most appropriate for your research question\nWrite analysis code in R, making it fully reproducible using Quarto/R Markdown\nTranslate code and replicate existing analyses from SAS, STATA, SPSS, or Jamovi\n\nMost of my expertise is in regression modeling, particularly in mixed-effects models for hypothesis testing, but I’m also familiar with Bayesian frameworks, ANOVAs, and SEM.\nYou can see examples of my reproducible analysis code published alongside my dissertation and recent publication. I’d love to work more with academics about getting reproducible analysis work flows set up, since open science doesn’t work very well if other people (and future you) struggle to understand or reproduce the shared code.\nMy rates are currently $35-$45/hr for programming jobs (i.e., you know what stats you want to do and just need someone to set it up in R) and $50-$65/hr for consulting + programming jobs (i.e., you also want me to decide what stats to do).\n\n\nI primarily work in R using the tidyverse, but I’m also comfortable working in Python and Excel. More specific to psychology and linguistics research, I have experience:\n\nCoding experiments, primarily in PCIbex and also in MATLAB, Qualtrics, and PsychoPy\nSetting up online data collection to use AWS storage and time-consuming models to run on AWS servers\nTranslating legacy code that’s worked for years but is accumulating dependency and compatability issues, then validating the new code\nRecording and preprocessing eyetracking, audio, and text data\n\nMy rates for data preprocessing and data collection code are currently $35-$45/hr."

    "text": "I recently finished my PhD in Psychology, where my training focused on quantitative methods, cognitive psychology, and psycholinguistics. My dissertation investigated how people learn to use singular they pronouns and what kinds of contexts support learning. More broadly, I’m interested in questions about people’s learning and behavior, and in figuring out if systems and policies are working in the way we intend.\nI’m currently freelancing as a statistical consultant, statistical programmer, data scientist, and ggplot wizard for hire. I’m also on the full time job market, considering both industry and postdoc positions, primarily in the Philadelphia metro area, other Northeast cities, or remote."
